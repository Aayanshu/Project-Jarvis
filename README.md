Jarvis Virtual Assistant
Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant that can help you perform various tasks through voice commands. It can search Wikipedia, open websites, play music, send emails, tell the time, and more!

Features
Voice Recognition: Interact with the assistant using voice commands.
Wikipedia Search: Ask Jarvis to search for information on Wikipedia.
Web Browsing: Open websites like YouTube, Google, StackOverflow, etc.
Music Playback: Play your favorite songs from a local directory.
Email Sending: Send emails through Gmail using voice commands.
Time Reporting: Ask Jarvis for the current time.
Requirements
Before you start, make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed. You also need the following Python libraries:

pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.
SpeechRecognition: For converting speech to text.
wikipedia: For querying Wikipedia.
webbrowser: To open websites.
os: To interact with the system (e.g., playing music).
smtplib: For sending emails.
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyttsx3
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install wikipedia
Additionally, you may need to install pyaudio (a dependency for SpeechRecognition):

bash
Copy code
pip install pyaudio
If you face installation issues with pyaudio, please refer to this link for platform-specific installation instructions.

Setup
Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-assistant.git
cd jarvis-assistant
Configure Email:
To send emails, you'll need to configure your Gmail credentials in the sendEmail() function.
Important: Use an App Password if 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account.

python
Copy code
def sendEmail(to, content):
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.ehlo()
    server.starttls()
    server.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-app-password')  # Use your Gmail App Password
    server.sendmail('your-email@gmail.com', to, content)
    server.close()
Update Music Directory:
If you want Jarvis to play music from a specific folder, update the music_dir variable to point to your music directory:

python
Copy code
music_dir = 'D:\\Your\\Music\\Folder\\Path'
Usage
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python jarvis_assistant.py
Interact with Jarvis:

Once the script is running, it will greet you based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening).
You can give Jarvis commands like:
"Search Wikipedia for Python"
"Open YouTube"
"Play music"
"What's the time?"
"Send an email to Harry"
Command Examples:

Wikipedia Search:

Notes
Privacy:
This assistant uses the Google API for speech recognition, so make sure you're aware of the privacy implications. The audio is sent to Google's servers for processing.

Limitations:

The assistant relies on local files for music playback, so ensure the specified directory contains music files.
The Gmail login is done using a plain password, which is not recommended for production use. It's advisable to use OAuth or environment variables for security.
Improvements:

Add more functionality (e.g., weather reports, reminders).
Improve error handling for speech recognition and email sending.

#Jarvis Virtual Assistant
Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant that can assist you with various tasks through voice commands. It can search Wikipedia, open websites, play music, send emails, tell the time, and more!

Features
Voice Recognition: Interact with the assistant using voice commands.
Wikipedia Search: Ask Jarvis to search for information on Wikipedia.
Web Browsing: Open websites like YouTube, Google, StackOverflow, etc.
Music Playback: Play your favorite songs from a local directory.
Email Sending: Send emails through Gmail using voice commands.
Time Reporting: Ask Jarvis for the current time.
Requirements
Before you start, make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed. You also need the following Python libraries:

pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.
SpeechRecognition: For converting speech to text.
wikipedia: For querying Wikipedia.
webbrowser: To open websites.
os: To interact with the system (e.g., playing music).
smtplib: For sending emails.
python-dotenv: For managing environment variables (optional but recommended for security).
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyttsx3
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install wikipedia
pip install pyaudio  # Required for SpeechRecognition
pip install python-dotenv
Setup
Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-assistant.git
cd jarvis-assistant
Configure Email:
To send emails, you'll need to configure your Gmail credentials in the sendEmail() function.
Important: Use an App Password if 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account.

If you have 2FA enabled on your Google account, create an App Password.
For non-2FA accounts, enable "Less Secure Apps" here: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
You can securely store your Gmail credentials using environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

makefile
Copy code
SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
Update Music Directory:
If you want Jarvis to play music, set the music_dir variable to the path where your music files are stored.

python
Copy code
music_dir = 'D:\\Your\\Music\\Folder\\Path'  # Update to your music folder path
Run the Script:
Once everything is set up, run the script:

bash
Copy code
python jarvis_assistant.py
Jarvis will greet you and be ready to accept voice commands such as:

"Wikipedia Python"
"Open YouTube"
"Play music"
"What's the time?"
"Send an email to [name]"
How It Works
Key Functions
wishMe(): Greets the user based on the current time (morning, afternoon, evening).
takeCommand(): Listens for a voice command and returns the recognized text.
sendEmail(): Sends an email to a recipient using Gmail SMTP.
get_wikipedia_summary(): Retrieves a brief summary from Wikipedia based on a search query.
open_website(): Opens specified websites such as YouTube, Google, etc.
play_music(): Plays a song from a specified music directory on your computer.
main(): The core function that listens for commands and executes corresponding tasks.
Example Commands
Wikipedia Search:
"Wikipedia Python"
Jarvis will search Wikipedia for information about Python and summarize it.

Open Website:
"Open YouTube"
Jarvis will open the YouTube homepage in your default web browser.

Play Music:
"Play music"
Jarvis will play the first song in the specified directory.

Get the Time:
"What time is it?"
Jarvis will tell you the current time.

Send Email:
"Email to Harry"
Jarvis will ask for the content of the email and send it to the specified recipient.

Security
For security reasons, your email credentials (password or App Password) should not be hardcoded in the script. Instead, use environment variables to store them securely.

Example: Using .env for Environment Variables
Install the python-dotenv library (if you haven't already):

bash
Copy code
pip install python-dotenv
Create a .env file in the project directory with the following content:

makefile
Copy code
SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your-app-password
Modify the code to load environment variables from the .env file:

python
Copy code
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file

sender_email = os.getenv("SENDER_EMAIL")
sender_password = os.getenv("SENDER_PASSWORD")

Notes
Privacy:
This assistant uses the Google API for speech recognition, so make sure you're aware of the privacy implications. The audio is sent to Google's servers for processing.

Limitations:

The assistant relies on local files for music playback, so ensure the specified directory contains music files.
The Gmail login is done using a plain password, which is not recommended for production use. It's advisable to use OAuth or environment variables for security.
Improvements:

Add more functionality (e.g., weather reports, reminders).
Improve error handling for speech recognition and email sending.
Troubleshooting
Speech Recognition Not Working:
If you encounter issues with speech recognition, try reinstalling the pyaudio package, which is a dependency for the SpeechRecognition library.

bash
Copy code
pip install pyaudio
Email Not Sending:
If you encounter issues with sending emails, make sure that you have enabled access for less secure apps (or created an App Password) in your Gmail account.
